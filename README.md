# 🏦 Credit Card Fraud Detection Model — EECS 4412

This repository contains the full implementation, analysis, and results of our **Credit Card Fraud Detection** project completed for **EECS 4412 – Data Mining**.  
Our objective was to build an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** for fraud detection while handling extreme class imbalance and implementing one model **from scratch** using NumPy.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Credit card fraud detection is a highly challenging problem due to:

- **Severe class imbalance** (<0.2% fraud)
- **Non-linear feature relationships**
- **Anonymized PCA-transformed features (V1–V28)**
- **High financial cost of false negatives and false positives**

This project includes:

- Extensive **Phase 1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Full **preprocessing pipeline** (scaling, duplicate removal, imputation)
- A complete **scratch Logistic Regression implementation**
- Additional models:
  - Class-weighted Scikit-learn Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Detailed evaluation using **precision, recall, F1-score**, and accuracy
- Final report + video presentation

## 🧠 Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights:

### ✔ Class Imbalance  
Fraud represents only **0.17%** of all transactions → accuracy alone is misleading.

### ✔ Amount Distribution  
- Right-skewed  
- Most purchases are small  

### ✔ Time Feature  
- Displays periodic patterns  
- Potential daily cycles

### ✔ PCA Features  
- Strong correlation blocks  
- t-SNE reveals non-linear clusters of fraud

EDA was performed using:  
`matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `pandas`.

## 🛠️ Preprocessing Pipeline

Our data preprocessing includes:

- **Duplicate removal**  
  → Over 1,000 duplicates removed to avoid leakage
- **Mean imputation** for missing values
- **Feature scaling**  
  - `Time` → MinMax scaling  
  - `Amount` → Standardization  
- **Stratified 80/20 split**

The preprocessing ensures stable gradient descent and fair model evaluation.

## 🧮 Models Implemented

### 🔹 1. Logistic Regression (Scratch Implementation)
Implemented fully using **NumPy**, including:

- Sigmoid activation  
- Binary cross-entropy loss  
- Gradient descent updates  
- Weight & bias initialization  
- Loss history tracking  

This meets the course requirement for a model implemented *without* ML libraries.

---

### 🔹 2. Scikit-learn Logistic Regression
- Includes `class_weight='balanced'`
- Much higher recall, very low precision
- Useful for detecting all possible fraud cases

---

### 🔹 3. Random Forest Classifier
- Non-linear ensemble method  
- Best overall model  
- Captures interactions between PCA features

---

## 📊 Results Summary

| Model | Precision (Fraud) | Recall (Fraud) | F1 Score | Accuracy |
|------|-------------------|----------------|----------|----------|
| **Scratch Logistic Regression** | 0.789 | 0.316 | 0.451 | 99.87% |
| **Sklearn Logistic Regression** | 0.06 | 0.87 | 0.11 | 98% |
| **Random Forest Classifier** | **0.99** | **0.69** | **0.81** | **100%** |

### 🏆 Best Model: **Random Forest**
Reason:
- Handles severe imbalance  
- Captures non-linearities  
- Best trade-off between precision & recall
